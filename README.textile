h1. Ping.fm OSX Dashboard Widget

This is a handy little widget which lets you post status updates through
the "Ping.fm":http://ping.fm/ service.

If you're interested in the nerdy bits, "get the code":http://github.com/Oshuma/pingfm-widget/!

Or, you can just download a "release":http://github.com/Oshuma/pingfm-widget/tree/master/release and start pinging.
